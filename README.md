## work experience
For my work experience I worked at the city secret in Richmond, at the city secret me and two others had to work individually on a project, at first we were given a problem, we then analysed the problem and came to a conclusion that we needed to create a maths quiz for primary school kids, then I got to work by first making the angular page and then using atom to code in the features, first I started with the front page and then with the questions how they could answer the question and then the finishing touches.

I found this rather challenging but with the help of my supervisor I managed to make it through, this changed on what I think about coding on a different level, but I also found it exiting because I learned something new on those days

This has given me an experience on coding and how coding actually works because it is surprising that it is not as you think works, and with this experience this will help my in any future problems with coding.

On the first day I found out who I was working with and my employer and supervisor, the three us analysed a problem where a primary school maths teacher was looking for a quiz to use instead of making one himself, so we came up with a solution that we need a child friendly maths quiz with adding and subtracting questions and had a time limit of 2 minutes and make a scoreboard for them to put their scores on, so we started coding and by that day I had being able to modify the front page, though it was a hard time getting used to the coding.

On the second day I had got it so the question randomly generated a add or subtract question with numbers between 1 and 20, and I also started working on the timer which had a time limit of 2 minutes

On the third day I finished the timer and got it so that the question and timer would show on the page.

On the fourth day I got it so it went on to the next page when the quiz started so it was just the questions and timer, I then add the restart button so that you could try again but it had a problem with not resetting timer or questions  

On the last day I sorted that problem out and made the submit button and at the last minutes the scoreboard which completed the quiz as a functional quiz.

If I had more time I would had designed the quiz better and had the quiz at different difficulties, and I would had added it so that you could add multiplications and division question,
